This code creates a left-aligned heading with a decorative double line effect on
the left side of the page. The design features a large red horizontal line
spanning half the width of the viewport, with a short double line (black on top,
red just below) placed on the left side overlapping the heading text. Background
red line (.line): A thick red horizontal line stretching from the left edge to
50% of the viewport width, vertically centered. Double short lines
(.short-line-black and .short-line-red): Two thin lines (black above red), each
50px wide, aligned to the left and vertically centered on the page, positioned
over the red background line. Heading text (.heading): Positioned on the left,
vertically centered, with a white background and padding to cover the lines
behind the text, ensuring readability. The whole layout uses absolute
positioning within a flex container (body) that is centered vertically with full
viewport height.
